The Help Command
===================

Using The Help Command
-------------------------

By default, there is a help command made for you. What it
does is walk through your commands, and formats it like
``<Command Name> Description``. This is then sorted out
by indents to signify a different cog. By default, your
commands will be in ``No Category``, which is always at the
bottom of the commands list.

Here is a simple example of the default behaviour:

::

    An example bot to showcase the discord.ext.commands extension
    module.

    There are a number of utility commands being showcased here.

    MyCoolCog:
      cool   Says if a user is cool.
    No Category:
      add    Adds two numbers together.
      choose Chooses between multiple choices.
      help   Shows this message
      joined Says when a member joined.
      repeat Repeats a message multiple times.
      roll   Rolls a dice in NdN format.

    Type !help command for more info on a command.
    You can also type !help category for more info on a category.

You may want to send help if the user doesn't use a command
correctly. Here is an example of how to do this:

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: sos.py
    :emphasize-lines: 8, 10, 18

    from discord.ext import commands

    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', description="Nothing to worry about here.")

    @bot.command()
    async def sos(ctx, what: str=None):
        """Send Help!"""
        if not what:
            return await ctx.send_help(sos)
        await ctx.send('Sending help for {0}!'.format(what))
        await ctx.send_help(what)

    class MyCoolCog(commands.Cog):
        """It's OK, we saved the damsel."""

        @commands.command()
        async def damsel(self, ctx):
            """There's a damsel in distress!"""
            await ctx.send_help(ctx.bot.get_cog('MyCoolCog'))

    bot.add_cog(MyCoolCog())

:meth:`~.commands.Context.send_help` allows you to specify a
:class:`~.commands.Command`, :class:`~commands.Cog`, or even
a regular string.

Let's take a look at this code step by step:

#. In the command ``sos``, there is a parameter of type ``str`` called ``what``.
    - If that parameter is not passed, it will send help for the ``sos`` :meth:`~.commands.Command` instance.
    - If the parameter is passed, it will send help for the string, which is used to look
      through cog names and commands.
      - Doing ``!sos damsel`` would try to find the command or cog named ``damsel``, and
        send the help for it.

#. In the cog ``MyCoolCog``, there is a docstring provided for help commands.

#. In the command ``damsel``, it will send help for the cog called ``MyCoolCog``, found via :meth:`~.commands.Bot.get_cog`.
    - This would send the docstring of ``MyCoolCog``, and its commands.

    ::

        It's OK, we saved the damsel.

        Commands:
          damsel There's a damsel in distress!

        Type !help command for more info on a command.
        You can also type !help category for more info on a category.

Replacing The Help Command
-----------------------------

If you don't like the default help command, you can replace
the normal help command by setting :attr:`~commands.Bot.help_command`
to a subclass of :class:`~.commands.HelpCommand`.

Here is an example of an alternative help command you can set,
:class:`~.commands.MinimalHelpCommand`

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: mini_help_bot.py
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    from discord.ext import commands

    description = """Hey! I am your local test bot."""
    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', description=description,
                       help_command=commands.MinimalHelpCommand())

By default, the help command appears in ``No Category``, which can
seem like a bit of a nuisance when categorising commands. One way
of doing this is by setting the :attr:`~.commands.DefaultHelpCommand.no_category`,
an attribute also found on :attr:`~.commands.MinimalHelpCommand`.

.. code-block:: python3
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    from discord.ext import commands

    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', description="There is no saviour.",
                       help_command=commands.DefaultHelpCommand(no_category='Help Me!'))

You can also set the :class:`~commands.Cog` of a help command,
simply by setting :attr:`~commands.HelpCommand.cog`. However,
if you plan on having the ability to reload or disable extensions
containing cogs, just setting it isn't wise idea.

To counter this, you could set the new help command to default,
 during the teardown of an extension.

.. code-block:: python3
    :emphasize-lines: 22-23

    from discord.ext import commands


    class Help(commands.Cog):
        """This isn't the right place for help."""

        @commands.command()
        async def sos(self, ctx, what: str = None):
            """Send Help!"""
            if not what:
                return await ctx.send_help(self.sos)
            await ctx.send('Sending help for {0}!'.format(what))
            await ctx.send_help(what)


    def setup(bot):
        bot.add_cog(Help())
        bot.help_command = commands.DefaultHelpCommand(no_category='Help.')
        bot.help_command.cog = bot.get_cog('Help')


    def teardown(bot):
        bot.help_command = commands.DefaultHelpCommand()

Here is an example of what you are able to do by subclassing
:class:`~.commands.MinimalHelpCommand`:

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: roo_ez.py

    from discord.ext import commands

    class MyHelp(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(no_category='Misc')

        def add_bot_commands_formatting(self, commands, heading):
            if commands:
                joined = ', '.join('`{0}`'.format(c.name) for c in commands)
                self.paginator.add_line('Category: [__**%s**__]' % heading)
                self.paginator.add_line(joined)

    description = """rooEZ"""
    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', description=description, help_command=MyHelp())

Writing A Help Command
-------------------------

For this tutorial, we will be using the standard :class:`~.commands.HelpCommand`.


The Help Command Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to use a different name for the help command, there is an option to change it:

.. code-block:: python3

    class MyHelpCommand(commands.HelpCommand):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(command_attrs={'name': 'commands'})

This allows the help command to be called via ``!commands``.


Bot Help
~~~~~~~~

The main help sent when ``!help`` is called can be described here:

::

    This is my cool bot made in discord.py!                          ]--- Description

    Help:                                                            ]--- Cog Name
      sos     Send Help!                                             ]--- Cog Command
    â€‹No Category:                                                     ]--- No Cog
      add     Adds two numbers together.                             \
      choose  Chooses between multiple choices. This'll get cut...   |
      cool    Says if a user is cool.                                |
      help    Shows this message.                                    |--- No Cog Commands
      joined  Says when a member joined.                             |
      repeat  Repeats a message multiple times.                      |
      roll    Rolls a dice in NdN format.                            /

    Type ?help command for more info on a command.                   \___ Ending Note
    You can also type ?help category for more info on a category.    /

Most of this is done within :meth:`~commands.DefaultHelpCommand.send_bot_help`.

To make it a little easier, it should start off with:

.. code-block:: python3

    async def send_bot_help(self, mapping):
        ctx = self.context
        bot = ctx.bot


Description
+++++++++++

By default, the description is set when :class:`commands.Bot` is instantiated, with the
``description`` keyword argument: ``commands.Bot(description='Hey! This is my Cool Bot:tm:')``.

However, it is possible to disregard that, as it is only used in :meth:`~commands.DefaultHelpCommand.send_bot_help`.
This can be done by adding the line ``self.paginator.add_line('My Description!', empty=True)`` to the end of
the function.

In the default help command, the description is added first, then the category and commands are added.
The position of the description is entirely your choice.


Cog Name
++++++++

The cog name is usually determined by :attr:`~commands.Cog.qualified_name` - or ``No Category`` - and is formatted to
be: ``My Cog:`` or ``No Category:``.

In the default help command it is done as so:

.. code-block:: python3
    :emphasize-lines: 1-5

        no_category = '\u200b{0.no_category}:'.format(self)                                # if there's no category
        def get_category(command, *, no_category=no_category):                             # gets the correct category name
            cog = command.cog
            return cog.qualified_name + ':' if cog is not None else no_category

        filtered = await self.filter_commands(bot.commands, sort=True, key=get_category)   # filters the commands,
        max_size = self.get_max_size(filtered)
        to_iterate = itertools.groupby(filtered, key=get_category)

The first few lines describe the formatting, then the next lines format each command to its category correctly.
``No Category:`` is set when you instantiate :class:`commands.DefaultHelpCommand`: ``HelpCommand(no_category='Misc.')``.
You could completely disregard this property, and set it as the ``no_category`` variable: ``no_category = '<Miscellaneous>'``
The next local function, ``get_category`` determines :attr:`commands.Command.cog`'s name via
:attr:`commands.Cog.qualified_name`.

.. code-block:: python3

        no_category = '<Miscellaneous>'
        def get_category(command, *, no_category=no_category):
            cog = command.cog
            return '<' + cog.qualified_name + '>' if cog is not None else no_category

Command
+++++++
